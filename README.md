## ⚠️ Read This First

This is **not a complete or fully functional website**.

Some planned features were never developed and, in this version, **none of the secondary pages were implemented**. What you’ll find here is mostly the **structure and visual concept of the homepage**.

If you’re looking for a finished product, this isn’t it.

## ✦ About the Project

This project prioritizes **visual identity over functionality**.

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are intentionally incomplete. The goal was to explore layout, mood, and atmosphere — not to build something production-ready. Treat this as a **visual prototype** or an aesthetic experiment rather than a full website.

Like many Neocities sites, this project embraces:
- Personality over polish  
- Expression over optimization  
- Style over strict UX rules  

Early 2000s web aesthetics were a conscious choice: imperfect, decorative, expressive, and a little chaotic by nature. (￣▽￣)ノ

## ✦ Assets & Credits

Most visual assets (images, gifs, icons, etc.) are **hidden or not included** in this repository.

Why?
- Many assets are **not my original work**
- I don’t feel comfortable redistributing third-party material as if it were mine

Only a small portion of the assets were created by me.  
If you reuse this project, you **must replace the assets** with your own or properly sourced ones.

## ✦ Usage & License (Informal)

You are free to:
- Use this project as a **template**
- Use it as **inspiration**
- Modify it for your own Neocities or personal website

Keep in mind:
- The code is incomplete
- You’ll need to finish or adapt features yourself
- This project values aesthetics over scalability or clean architecture

If you use or adapt this work, **please provide proper credit whenever possible**.  
It’s not mandatory, but it’s appreciated. (´･ω･`)

## ✦ Final Notes

This repository is a **time capsule** — a version of my creative process that no longer fully represents who I am, but still matters as a reference and learning experience.

Use it freely.  
Just be mindful of its context.
